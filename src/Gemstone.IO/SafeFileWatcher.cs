/// Represents a wrapper around the native .NET <see cref="FileSystemWatcher"/> that avoids problems with
/// dangling references when using a file watcher instance as a class member that never gets disposed.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The design goal of the SafeFileWatcher is to avoid accidental memory leaks caused by use of .NET's native
/// file system watcher when used as a member of a class that consumers fail to properly dispose. If a class
/// has a reference to a file watcher as a member variable and attaches to the file watcher's events, the
/// file watcher will maintain a reference the parent class so it can call its event handler. If the parent
/// class is not disposed properly, the file watcher will thus not be disposed and will maintain the
/// reference to the parent class - the garbage collector will never collect the parent because it has a
/// valid reference and no collection means the parent finalizer will never get called and the file system
/// watcher will never get disposed. Creating multiple instances of parent class and not disposing of them
/// will cause a memory leak even with a properly designed disposable pattern. Using the SafeFileWatcher
/// instead of directly using the FileSystemWatcher will resolve this potential issue.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Note that component model implementation is not fully replicated - if you are using a file system watcher
/// on a design surface, this safety wrapper will usually not be needed. This class has benefit when a class
/// will dynamically use a file watcher and needs to make sure any unmanaged resources get properly released
/// even if a consumer neglects to call the dispose function.
